## Display Handling

It's not easy to see the pattern in the character ROM, but it's there.

```
0x08 xx001000
0x14 xx010100
0x22 xx100010
0x22 xx100010
0x3E xx111110
0x22 xx100010
0x22 xx100010
0x00 xxxxxxxx
```

Apple II text mode : still uses 280x192 matrix.
Each character is 7 x 8 pixels.
280 / 7 = 40 columns.
192 / 8 = 24 rows.

Pixel size: Each character is made up of a 5x7 pixel bitmap, but displayed as a 7x8 character cell on the screen.
there will be 1 pixel of padding on each side of the character.

Testing the TIGR library.

It looks like you do the following:
    create the display window.
    draw various things to the buffer.
    update the display.
So we can accumulate changes to the display memory/display buffer, and only update the display when we are ready to show it.
Say once each 1/60th of a second.
I guess we'll see how fast it is.
To start, update buffer every time we write to the screen.

well that sort of works! don't know if it's fast enough, but ok for now.

trying to boot actual apple 2 plus roms. Getting an infinite loop at f181 - 
this is testing how much memory by writing into every page. unfortunately everything
in the system right now is "ram" so it's never finding the end of ram ha ha.

OK that's fixed and it now boots to the keyboard loop! Though the prompt is missing, and there is no cursor because there
is no inverse or flash support right now.
Tigr doesn't look to be very flexible for keyboard input. It is very simple but may not do the trick.
Next one to try: SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/

## Looking at SDL2

Downloaded source from:
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.10

If you are building "the Unix way," we encourage you to use build-scripts/clang-fat.sh in the SDL source tree for your compiler:

mkdir build
cd build 
CC=/where/i/cloned/SDL/build-scripts/clang-fat.sh ../configure
make

the main GIT repo is version 3.0.
Lots of deprecations warnings, but it built.

Well, this is the easier way:

```
bazyar@Jawaids-MacBook-Pro gssquared % brew install sdl2
==> Auto-updating Homebrew...
Adjust how often this is run with HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS or disable with
```

I'm going to go ahead and scrap the Tigr code because SDL2 looks like it will do the trick.

## Keyboard Logic

What better way to spend Christmas than writing an Apple II emulator?

SDL2 is better. I got the actual character ROM working. Looks pretty good.

Now working on the keyboard.

Currently keyboard code is inside the display code. This is not good.
SDL's use scope is broader than just the display. So we should move this out
into a more generalized module, that calls into display and keyboard 
and other 'devices' as needed.

OK, the SDL2 keyboard code is segregated out properly, and the keyboard code is working pretty well.

If a key has been pressed, its value is in the keyboard latch, 0xC000. The Bit 7 will be set if the strobe hasn't been cleared.
Clear the strobe by writing to 0xC010.

Looking at where I hook this in..

This is the SDL2 documentation for the keycodes:

https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_keycode.h


## Dec 25, 2024

I'm going to go ahead and scrap the Tigr code because SDL2 looks like it will do the trick.

For reference, the current design target is Apple II+ level.

I have some options for the next piece to tackle. Generally speaking, here is the project
status:

1. NMOS 6502 - (Complete.)
1. Keyboard - Complete. There may be tweaks needed.
1. 40-column text mode - Complete. Supports normal, inverse, and flash.

1. 40-column text mode - Screen 2. (Complete)
1. Low-resolution graphics - not started.
1. High-resolution graphics - not started.
1. Disk II Controller Card - Not started.
1. Sound - not started.
1. Printer / parallel port - not started.
1. Printer / serial port - not started.
1. Cassette - not started.
1. Joystick / paddles - not started.

Pretty much all of this is carried forward into the Apple IIe, IIc, and IIgs,
with the exception that the IIe non-enhanced uses 65n02, IIe enhanced uses 65c02, and IIc 
does also. Of course, the IIgs uses the 65816.

What is the best piece to tackle next? I think I'll work on the graphics modes. Not much I
can boot off a disk will do much without them.

## 40-column text mode - Screen 2

Poking 0xC055 will enable screen 2. It's still a 40-column text mode but it uses
memory at 0x0800-0x0BFF instead of 0x0400-0x07FF.

0xC054 will return to screen 1. These two flags affect text, lo-res, and hi-res graphics.

This should be a pretty easy piece to tackle.

We'll need:
   handlers to catch the accesses to 0xC054, 0xC055. When these are accessed we change
   the display buffer base address, and redraw the whole screen (only if the mode has changed).
   And we need to monitor for writes to the new display buffer base address.

This is where I want to implement the jump table for handling the 0xC000 - 0xC07F space.

### Low-resolution graphics

The low-resolution graphics are 40 x 48 blocks, 16 colors. Each nibble in a display page
byte represents a block. These will be 8 x 4 pixels in terms of the current display
buffer design. The color is one of a specific palette of 16 colors:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics

### High-resolution graphics

Implemented in fake green-screen mode.

Bugs:
[ ] text line 21 does not update in mixed mode.


## Dec 26, 2024

Oddly, when I switch to screen 2, the display comes up. 
And when I write to 0x0800 with a character, it displays.
but it's not supposed to. txt_memory_write is not being called.
so it must be the flash handler. Try disabling that and see if the screen
doesn't update as expected.
if so, then the flash handler is updating too much.

Testing emulation speed.
Every 5 seconds, print the number of cycles since the last 5 seconds.
it's hovering around 1000000 cycles per second:

```
3747795 cycles
5194629 cycles
5233284 cycles
5287931 cycles
5082248 cycles
```

the low number was when generating tons of video display debug output.
I am running in the free-run mode, so slowness is not due to the clock sync emulation
let me turn off the display.
ok the display update is off, and it's in the same area. And it started at about 6M and worked its way down to 5.1.
it's pretty consistent..

```
5796507 cycles
6093662 cycles
5983934 cycles
5550091 cycles
5107896 cycles
5123350 cycles
5147278 cycles
5142563 cycles
5118742 cycles
5123895 cycles
```
am I sure I'm in free run ? I am.

SO. I was calling event_poll() every time through the instruction loop. So. Many. Times.
I put it inside the check for the display update, once every 1/60th second. This is per
docs that suggest "once per frame".

Removing that, I get a effective MHz speed of 150MHz, with optimizations -O3 enabled.
With -O0, I get about 61MHz effective, at free-run mode.
And of course I can turn off free mode.

I should implement some keyboard commands to toggle free-run mode. F9. That's convenient.
Maybe a key to toggle certain debug flags?

F9 works well. I should have it toggle between free-run, 1MHz, and 2.8MHz.

ok, that is working. I changed free-run from a flag, to a enum mode. So we can add other modes and even specify the exact mode.

This is a fun little program. Appleosft, and all text mode.
https://www.leucht.com/blog/2016/09/my-apple-iie-a-simple-text-based-arcade-game-in-applesoft-basic/
works just fine. All the scrolling causes the emulator to slow down to 3MHz effective rate.

It may end up being better to just draw the screen 60 times a second, and not worry about updating for every character. That feels weird, but, this
may be the modern way. 

ok let's think about this. 16 milliseconds per frame. 0.000087 seconds per scanline. (192 scanlines * 60 frames, 11520 scanlines per second).

I should only be copying the back buffer each frame, 16ms. this slows down to 1MHz:!
10 A=1
20 PRINT A
30 A = A + 1
40 GOTO 20

So something is wrong. This ought to FLY.

So let's try that other approach. Instead of updating the display for every character,
we'll just redraw the screen every 16ms. Will this be faster?

## Dec 27, 2024

Big performance drain on the video display.

Something that causes tons of scrolling:

795867523 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 159.173508 MHz
796674469 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 159.334900 MHz
218963831 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 43.792767 MHz
5476743 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.095349 MHz
5443788 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.088758 MHz

Effective performance drops to 1MHz.

Sample shows:

we're doing tons of SDL related calls. They're probably fairly expensive ones.
I'll note that if we're doing a scroll, then we're reading every character on the screen (pure
memory copy is fast), but then writing every character on the screen - which generates a call to 
render_text for every character on the screen.
Render character is a loop in C that is 56 total iterations; so that's around 60K iterations of generating
the character bitmap.
Let's get rid of that inner loop by pre-generating the character bitmap.
Each Apple II character is 7x8 pixels. One bit per pixel.
The output we need to feed into SDL2 is 32-bit values, one per pixel.
So one character becomes 64 bytes, pre-coded. 

ok well that generated this:
5468271 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.093654 MHz
5356073 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.071215 MHz

basically no change.
I still have a loop. And while I unrolled it, I am still copying from main RAM to the texture.
So that's expensive.
Can I create a second texture that just contains the character bitmaps, and then copy chunks of
that to the screen?

ok look at row at a time.
txt_memory_write is called for each byte written.
currently it calculates row and column from the address.
Now, it will just calculate row, and mark the row as dirty.
on a screen update, we recalculate the dirty rows and render them.

Wow, holy cow. So what I implemented:
dirty line checker. (24 element array)
txt_memory_write is called for each byte written. But this now ONLY marks the line as dirty.
The actual rendering is done in update_display which is called every 16ms.
That scans the dirty line array. For each dirty line, it renders the line.
I can do 2000.7fff in the rom monitor - which dumps 28KBytes of memory.
It occurs virtually instantly.
This is because no matter how many characters are written to vram, the actual rendering
is of at most 24 lines, 60 times per second. So that limits the number of locks.
So, this could probably render all 24 lines at a time no matter what. I guess I should
try that because it would simplify flash mode etc. Flash wasn't hard at all - just
identify screen rows that have a flashing character, then mark the row as dirty. And
move the flash state to a global so it's accessible to the other routines.

### Apple III info:

For reference:
https://www.apple3.org/Documents/Magazines/AppleIIIExtendedAddressing.html

## Dec 28, 2024

The clock cycle emulation is a bit off. I am sleeping the calculated amount. But, at start of each cycle
we need to do:

When CPU is 'booted', we do this:
next_time = current_time + cycle_duration_ticks

do work

when we call "emulate_clock_cycle", we do this:
if (next_time < current_time) {
   clock_slip++;
   next_time = current_time + cycle_duration_ticks;
} else {
   sleep (next_time - current_time);
   next_time = next_time + cycle_duration_ticks;
}

The very first time through we'll likely have a big clock slip, which is fine. But we should
generally not have them otherwise.
I am currently sleeping for cycle_duration_ticks without taking into account the time it takes
to do the work.

Well, it's a little better. I'm hovering pretty close to 1.024 / 2.8mhz.

next: speaker, or lo-res graphics?

## Speaker

Let's look at the audio. This will not be fun.

https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/sdl-mixer-accuracy/25160
https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2016/09/05/making-music-on-the-apple-ii/

Each tweak of $C030 causes the speaker to pop in, or the speaker to pop out.
If we do the in and out 880 times per second, we'll get an A tone (440 hz)- though not a pleasing round one.
How do we convert this to a WAV file type stream?
a WAV file with a 440hzsquare wave in it, has 96 samples of $2000, followed by 96 samples of $E000.
These are UNSIGNED 16-bit samples. $8000 is 0 (neutral). $e000 is plus $6000, $2000 is minus $6000, i.e. 75% volume.

Presumably it will take a certain amount of time for the speaker cone to travel.
And once we stop pinging the speaker, it stops moving.
Maybe we can simulate that.
We keep track of a direction.
then generate pre-defined samples for predetermined time period.
Use signed samples.
Each hit on the C030 generates either positive samples, or negative samples.
these are added to the current buffer. E.g. if there was a positive, then they hit the
speaker again really fast, it will cancel out the first hit.
hitting it twice in a row one right after the other will cancel out the first completely.
Test this. YES. That is corect. I get a quiet sound, just like the article was saying.

So, we can test different waveforms to add into here. 
How long those waveforms are will determine the size of the buffer.
This will only work at lower virtual cpu speeds. Or, we can slow down the clock for N cycles after a
speaker hit, hoping that stays inside the sound loop. (or does apple iigs software change the timing for this?)
For now, assume 1MHz clock speed.

So the Apple II speaker is: a 1-bit DAC, where every other access is the inverse sign of the previous one.

We assume: a ramp-up time; a hold time; a ramp-down time. The ramp-up and ramp-down are probably very similar.
I don't know the hold time, but, we can try different values. And to go from negative to positive there
will be overall double the ramp time.

4 + 4 + 2 + 216 * (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) + 3 + 2 
   216 * (17) = 3672

my test code is xd8 (216) iterations at about 20 cycles each iteration, or, 3672 cycles.
An up and down is therefore 7360 cycles. at 1MHz, that is 138 per second. That doesn't sound right.

In any given cycle, if the speaker is hit, add the sample to the buffer at the time index.
The time index for the audio buffer is calculated in 1023000 cycles per second.

The waveform timing won't change with the clock speed, because it's a physical property of the speaker.

## Dec 29, 2024

ok. SDL_OpenAudioDevice is the function we need for audio streams. When you call it, you set a callback
function. SDL calls it whenever it needs more audio data. So we just need to buffer data to always have some for it.
If we ever don't have enough we'll have to send back 0's (or fill with whatever the last sample was), and this will be
perceived as a skip/glitch in the audio.

Start with a short standalone program. I will return a short square wave every X ms.

Hmm, there is another method. SDL can also do a push method. We call "QueueAudio periodically to feed it
more data. That is the model I was looking for originally. I like the callback model. It is asynchronous -
is it even multithreaded?

ok sample program audio.cpp is generating some blips.
Each time I am being asked for more data, I am sending 4096 samples. 4096 is 10.766 per second. That is awkward.
100 per second would be 441 samples. Try that. 
Yes, that's 100 per second - frame is 10ms. 

What is a reasonable time period I can use for buffering?
We don't want it to be too long, or there will be latency.

the AI says:
#### Summary of the Process

1. Intercept $C030 reads in the emulator:
   1. Toggle an internal speakerState.
   1. Record the time of the toggle as an event.
1. Accumulate toggles over emulated cycles.
1. Resample to the host’s audio rate (e.g., 44.1 kHz) by stepping through time or through the toggle events.
1. Write each sample as a 16-bit signed integer (e.g., +32767 for “high,” –32768 for “low,” or some scaled variant).
1. Feed that buffer to the host OS audio API in blocks (e.g., every 1/60 second or 1/100 second).

This is an interesting approach. however, if we just slammed on $C030 nonstop it would be a lot of memory?
no, only 1/60th of a second's worth. That is maybe on the order of 4262 samples. So a reasonable amount of memory.
Keep the events in a circular buffer.
Each event is just recording the number of cycles.
Each buffer records the current cycle index too.
So then we play through the buffer until we reach the current cycle index.
Each event is laid into our output audio buffer at the appropriate time index.
at 50000 samples per second, each sample is 20us. To simulate a 'tick', we would paint 10 samples
into the output buffer.

For testing, I can dump a time-series log of the events into a file, from inside
the emulator. Then analyze that data in a separate program. "Play it back". Easier to test.
have F8 start and stop the audio recording.

That's working. I can dump the events to a file.
Recording what happens just on a boot - I get exactly 192 events. That is one of those "ah ha"
numbers. 
11871
12402
12933
...
113292

etc.
Each of these is exactly 531 cycles apart.
101421 cycles total duration.
So about 1/10th second.

531 cycles is half the frequency. So, 1062 cycles is a full oscillation.
I read that as 963Hz.

I might be off on my cycle counts a bit. Something to look into.

OK, now let's write the playback code.
Let's generate a 1/60th second buffer each chunk - that will make us have about 6 chunks.
that is 735 samples per chunk.

I think in my math I was slightly off. This might be why:

https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/MiscInfo/Empson/videocycles

```
> Or is the difference too small to be noticeable (hearable? What about
> processor loops that access  $c030? Could you hear a "background-humming"?

If you were trying to generate a precise tone, you would need to allow
for this when determining the number of CPU cycles between accesses to
$C030, i.e. work on the assumption that the CPU is executing uniform
cycles at 1.0205 MHz instead of 1.0227 MHz.
```

Some great resources Apple IIers posted in response to this:

## Dec 30, 2024

OK some of my cycle counts are off. There are no single-cycle instructions, but my
current implementation has all the flag instructions at 1 cycle for instance. So
that's wrong. Also PLA and RTS are 2 cycles too fast.
The following instructions in the beep loop are the wrong cycle counts:
SEC, PLA, RTS

After fixing these, I have 546 cycles between hits on $C030 instead of 531.
That is 2.82% slower through the loop, which should bring the tone down a hair.
However, now my beep is at 926Hz according to the spectrum analyzer.

The SA says the real apple II beep peak is at maybe 937Hz. 915-958 for the whole hump.
Reproduced is 872-969 with peak at 926Hz. Ah, so I need to bring that bottom end up a bit.
That difference is 1.17%, 1.2%.

In the recreation code I have one sample as 2.3us. That's wrong. They're 22.6us.
But I think there is an assumption that 1us = 1 cycle which is not quite right. It's 1% slow. And that's about how far
off we are, 1% low.

Grabbed the "Understanding the Apple II" books. I have some assumptions about clocking that are
not quite right. And would be incredibly hard to replicate. And are probably not the reason for
the differences.

### Audio update


I need to add the concept of an audio buffer.
Each 'event' I need to paint a BLIP worth of samples into the output audio stream. Currently this is 434 samples but it could be an arbitrary number. And, I need to ensure that ALL the samples that are part of a blip, get put into the output, even if they get painted beyond the current audio frame being requested via the sdl2 audio callback.

So, I need an intermediate buffer.

Weird, my speaker_event_log file had the wrong data in it?? Re-ran GS2 with a test of the 
beep routine, and now it's 546 cycles between events as I noted earlier. Weird.

now my "audio working" is too low. Way too low. I went the wrong way.

## Dec 31, 2024

So the audio callback cycle counter is running quite a bit faster than the cpu.
```
4568199 delta 24826466 cycles clock-mode: 2 CPS: 0.913640 MHz [ slips: 8739, busy: 24817727, sleep: 0]
audio_callback 35325884 35342835 0
```

I'm getting 300 audio frames per 5 seconds, that's correct, because I set it up at 60 frames per second.
in that same interval 5,166,383 cycles. 1033276.6 per second average.
But the audio clock ticked up from  25629912 to 30715212 or delta of 5085300.
That's a slight difference but does not account for the discrepancy of 10M cycles.

We want the audio cycle counter to run just behind the cpu cycle counter, such that the 
current cpu cycle count is always greater than the audio cycle count.
So if the audio cycle window count is > cpu_cycle_count, set

buf_start_cycle = cpu_cycle_count - cycles_per_buffer
buf_end_cycle = buf_start_cycle + cycles_per_buffer

see what that does.
We could store time markers as events in the event buffer, and have audio_callback continuously sync to that..

```
    if (buf_end_cycle > speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles) {
        std::cout << "audio cycle overrun resync from " << buf_end_cycle << " to " << speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER << "\n";
        buf_start_cycle = speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
        buf_end_cycle = buf_start_cycle + CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
    } else if (buf_end_cycle < speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER) {
        std::cout << "audio cycle underrunresync from " << buf_end_cycle << " to " << speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER << "\n";
        buf_start_cycle = speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
        buf_end_cycle = buf_start_cycle + CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
    } else {
```

OK, that is keeping it synced, however, I'm getting a lot of overruns and underruns and audio artifacts.
But, the window is staying aligned to the CPU cycle count and I am not getting into situations where
the audio is lagging.

My alternative here is to push audio stream, instead of having SDL2 pull it.

I made a loader function - passing -a filename will load a file into RAM at 0x0801, assuming applesoft basic.
That let me load Lemonade Stand. he he. Lots of sound in there, really shows the issue with audio sync.

I have added some extra 'guardrails' around the buffering, and I improved results and reduced underrun and overrun. But I'm still not entirely happy with the results. I'm going to have to just grind out some hard thinking on it.

And, it definitely only works in 1MHz. Actually, let's see what insanity ensues at free-run..
(I'm wondering if I can try syncing not to hard-set 1.0205 but to whatever the specified clock speed is)
Ah, at 2.8 it's sort of legible but super fast. And at free run the entire segment plays a short tone and then
skips to the next screen in under a second, lol.

https://github.com/kurtjd/rust-apple2/blob/main/src/sound.rs

This is an apple 2 emulator written in Rust, and this is the sound code.

** ok, well now. I took out the display optimization. effective cycles per second is 1.01xxxmhz. I think the audio is working better.
[ ] So it's due to the cpu clock running slightly faster than the audio timing.


## Lo-Res Graphics

Let's do a sprint to get LORES:

OK that was largely working. 

[x] Now, however, I have a bug where when I type 'GR' it only partially clears the screen. There must be a race condition somewhere. (Fixed. in text_40x24.cpp:txt_memory_write I was not setting dirty flag on line when in lores mode.) (This has a hack in in regarding hi-res mode).



## Cassette Interface

On the one hand this seems silly. On the other hand, it is vintage cool, and there are actually web sites that distribute audio streams of old games stored in audio files, that you can play into an Apple II.

https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/143/what-format-is-used-for-apple-ii-cassette-tapes

The Apple II recorded data as a frequency-modulated sine wave. A standard consumer cassette deck could be connected to the dedicated cassette port on the Apple ][, ][+, and //e. The //c, ///, and IIgs did not have this port.

A tape could hold one or more chunks of data, each of which had the following structure:

Entry tone: 10.6 seconds of 770Hz (8192 cycles at 1300 usec/cycle). This let the human operator know that the start of data had been found.
Tape-in edge: 1/2 cycle at 400 usec/cycle, followed by 1/2 cycle at 500 usec/cycle. This "short zero" indicated the transition between header and data.
Data: one cycle per bit, using 500 usec/cycle for 0 and 1000 usec/cycle for 1.
There is no "end of data" indication, so it's up to the reader to specify the length of data. The last byte of data is followed by an XOR checksum, initialized to $FF, that can be used to check for success.

For machine-language programs, the length is specified on the monitor command line, e.g. 800.1FFFR would read $1800 (6144) bytes. For BASIC programs and data, the length is included in an initial header section:

Integer BASIC programs have a two-byte (little-endian) length.
Applesoft BASIC has a two-byte length, followed by a "run" flag byte.
Applesoft shape tables (loaded with SHLOAD) have a two-byte length.
Applesoft arrays (loaded with RECALL) have a three-byte header.
Note the header section is a full data area, complete with 10.6-second lead-in.

The storage density varies from 2000bps for a file full of 0 bits to 1000bps for a file full of 1 bits. Assuming an equal distribution of bits, you can expect to transfer about 187 bytes/second (ignoring the header).

An annotated 6502 assembly listing, as well as C++ code for deciphering cassette data in WAV files, can be found here. The code in the system monitor that reads and writes data is less then 200 bytes long.


## Pascal Firmware Protocol

The Pascal protocol seems to be geared towards I/O, like serial devices, and displays.
However, there are "device class" assignments for :
Printer, Joystick, Serial/parallel, modem, sound/speech device, clock, mass-storage, 80 column card, network or bus interface, special purpose, and reserved.

Unclear how widely-supported this is.

## Generic Disk Interface - proposed

Propose:

```
C0S0 - lo byte of sector number
C0S1 - hi byte of sector number
C0S2 - target address lo byte
C0S3 - target address hi byte
C0S4 - sector count
C0S5 - write command. 1 = read, 2 = write.
```

someone could easily accidentally write garbage to the disk.
