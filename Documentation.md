Info on the character set:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_character_set


It's not easy to see the pattern in the character ROM, but it's there.

```
0x08 xx001000
0x14 xx010100
0x22 xx100010
0x22 xx100010
0x3E xx111110
0x22 xx100010
0x22 xx100010
0x00 xxxxxxxx
```

Apple II text mode : still uses 280x192 matrix.
Each character is 7 x 8 pixels.
280 / 7 = 40 columns.
192 / 8 = 24 rows.

Pixel size: Each character is made up of a 5x7 pixel bitmap, but displayed as a 7x8 character cell on the screen.
there will be 1 pixel of padding on each side of the character.

Testing the TIGR library.

It looks like you do the following:
    create the display window.
    draw various things to the buffer.
    update the display.
So we can accumulate changes to the display memory/display buffer, and only update the display when we are ready to show it.
Say once each 1/60th of a second.
I guess we'll see how fast it is.
To start, update buffer every time we write to the screen.

well that sort of works! don't know if it's fast enough, but ok for now.

trying to boot actual apple 2 plus roms. Getting an infinite loop at f181 - 
this is testing how much memory by writing into every page. unfortunately everything
in the system right now is "ram" so it's never finding the end of ram ha ha.

OK that's fixed and it now boots to the keyboard loop! Though the prompt is missing, and there is no cursor because there
is no inverse or flash support right now.
Tigr doesn't look to be very flexible for keyboard input. It is very simple but may not do the trick.
Next one to try: SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/

## Looking at SDL2

Downloaded source from:
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.10

If you are building "the Unix way," we encourage you to use build-scripts/clang-fat.sh in the SDL source tree for your compiler:

mkdir build
cd build 
CC=/where/i/cloned/SDL/build-scripts/clang-fat.sh ../configure
make

the main GIT repo is version 3.0.
Lots of deprecations warnings, but it built.

Well, this is the easier way:

```
bazyar@Jawaids-MacBook-Pro gssquared % brew install sdl2
==> Auto-updating Homebrew...
Adjust how often this is run with HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS or disable with
```

I'm going to go ahead and scrap the Tigr code because SDL2 looks like it will do the trick.

## Keyboard Logic

What better way to spend Christmas than writing an Apple II emulator?

SDL2 is better. I got the actual character ROM working. Looks pretty good.

Now working on the keyboard.

If a key has been pressed, its value is in the keyboard latch, 0xC000. The Bit 7 will be set if the strobe hasn't been cleared.
Clear the strobe by writing to 0xC010.

Looking at where I hook this in..

This is the SDL2 documentation for the keycodes:

https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_keycode.h

Status of keyboard:

1. control keys: YES
1. shift keys: YES
1. arrow keys: YES. II+ only has left and right arrow keys.
1. Escape key: YES
1. RESET key: YES. Map Control+F10 to this.
1. EXIT key: YES. Map F12 to this.
1. REPT key: no. But we don't need this, autorepeat is working. Ignore this.
1. Backspace - YES. This apparently maps to same as back arrow. Got lucky.

Currently keyboard code is inside the display code. This is not good.
SDL's use scope is broader than just the display. So we should move this out
into a more generalized module, that calls into display and keyboard 
and other 'devices' as needed.

OK, the SDL2 keyboard code is segregated out properly, and the keyboard code is working pretty well.
